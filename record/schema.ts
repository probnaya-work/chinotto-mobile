/**
 * The Record model on mobile — schema v2.
 *
 * This is the mobile expression of the same durable model the desktop app holds in
 * `src-tauri/src/db/schema_v2.sql`. The table shapes, the column meanings and the
 * canonical/derived split are deliberately identical: a Fragment means the same thing on
 * both devices, and neither side may quietly invent a second interpretation.
 *
 * CANONICAL vs DERIVED is load-bearing. Canonical tables hold user material and user
 * judgements and are never regenerated. Derived tables are caches: they may be dropped and
 * rebuilt at any time without losing anything a person wrote or decided.
 *
 * v1 tables (`entries`, `user_themes`, `entry_themes`, `entry_engagement` and the four sync
 * outboxes) are NOT touched by this file. `migrate.ts` copies out of them and leaves them in
 * place, so the migration stays reversible and the deployed sync contract keeps working.
 *
 * Differences from desktop, and why:
 *   * `fragments_fts` is created separately and guarded (see `ensureFts`), because FTS5 is a
 *     compile-time option and an expo-sqlite build without it must still open the database.
 *   * `voice_captures.audio_path` is stored RELATIVE to the app's document directory. iOS
 *     rewrites the container path on reinstall and on some restores, so an absolute path
 *     recorded today is wrong tomorrow.
 *   * `capture_origin` carries mobile's own sources — `widget` and `share` — which desktop
 *     has no way to produce. It is free text on both sides, so this costs nothing.
